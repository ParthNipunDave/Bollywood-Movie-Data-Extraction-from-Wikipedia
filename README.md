# Bollywood-Movie-Data-Extraction-from-Wikipedia
Extracted Bollywood movie data since the beginning of Bollywood industry till 2020-21.

This python script file will help you to extract movie data from wikipedia and store it into csv file.
It extracts data such as
<ul>
  <li>Release Year</li>
  <li>Title of movie</li>
  <li>Cast</li>
  <li>Director</li>
  <li>Genre (if there is)</li>
</ul>

I wrote this script to extract data in order to create a Bollywood Movie Recommender System. You can check out it's demo from <a href = "https://bollywoodrecommendation-system.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
